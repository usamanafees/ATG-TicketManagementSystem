********************


pageload() - This function is called first passing json object by the caller page.

line #8 - source listbox (div container) is emptied and added the json objects as items.
		These items are added by calling a custom function - addItems()
			
line #10+ - source and destination listboxes are made connectable and properties, events are registered.
		Events - beforeStop, change, stop, start - are used and implemented inline.
			
beforeStop - it will remove background, foreground colors for the item on the fly before it get
		added to the (one of the )listbox and click event is unregistered for it.
			 
change - This event handles the item position change within the listboxes.
		 had to use to fix a placeHolder jumping into the on-the-fly multiple items selected.		 
		 placeHolder item is added dynamically by jquery-ui when we move on-the-fly item up/down.
		 
start - Event raised when sorting begins. I used it to handle the multiple items selection for drag-drop.
		Takes the current active item,	checks for childs of parent(listbox) 
		which are too selected excluding the placeHolder. If childs found, 
		excluding itself, all other child items are added into the active item (as its childs)
		and gap/spaces are removed between the items (by style), required this while on-the-fly.
		
stop - 	Event raised after the moving/sorting items is completed. You cant get "ui.helper" object here
	instead use "ui.item". I used to handle the multiple items which dropped. It checks if dropped
	Active item has any childs, if it does it removes them from it and adds to the destination
 	listbox as its childs and removes the background-color and style (adds padding, margin spaces).

disableSelection() - disallows selecting the text in listboxes (default behavior through mouse).		

line #61 - registers the click event on items from both source and destination listboxes.
	   if no multi-select (ctrl key not pressed), it removes background-color for all items
	   in that listbox and applies background-color only to the clicked item (indicating selected).
			
CreateJson() - Creates JSON format data-string by iterating over destination listbox items.
		and stores it into a hidden field. Get invoked by the button click.
			
> You can use UpdatePanel or AJAX when button is clicked for Async-postback and not disturbing the dropped
   items in destination listbox.
> Asp.Net sample shows, how you can Bind serverside data to the source-listbox (as JSON data)
  and parse again the returned JSON from clientside during postback.
